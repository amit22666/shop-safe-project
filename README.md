## Problems that this project resolves
* It prevents crowding on shops thus preventing the chance of any physical contact and spread of virus.
* Contact tracing becomes simple since by this we have centralize data of customers visited at each shop.
* Reach of local shops increases and their manual and physical decreases by a significant amount.
* It's more time efficient and convenient rather than physically visiting a shop.
